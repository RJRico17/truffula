# Truffula Notes
As part of Wave 0, please fill out notes for each of the below files. They are in the order I recommend you go through them. A few bullet points for each file is enough. You don't need to have a perfect understanding of everything, but you should work to gain an idea of how the project is structured and what you'll need to implement. Note that there are programming techniques used here that we have not covered in class! You will need to do some light research around things like enums and and `java.io.File`.

PLEASE MAKE FREQUENT COMMITS AS YOU FILL OUT THIS FILE.

Looking like `app.java` is showing us all the different uses Truffula has for us. Its almost like a page for isntructions on how to use Truffula like a user guide. It also describes how Truffula works and what it does, its like a documentation. It also shows you the main method in where we actually run Truffula.
